# NCP End-to-End Handoff Packet

This document is the current restart/orchestration packet for the NCP project.
Use it as the primary context for Claude, OpenCode, or another bounded coding
agent instead of replaying long chat history.

## Current State

Released:

- PyPI: `neural-context-protocol==0.2.0` *(pending publish)*
- GitHub tag: `v0.2.0` (commit `dff06a7`)
- Suite: `236 passed, 6 skipped`
- Live pgvector + Redis integration suite: `6 passed`

## What Shipped In 0.2.0

### Storage

- `store.type = "pgvector"` durable store: chunk writes/query, working-zone
  reads, recent-ref turn logging, conscious snapshots, cost logging,
  goal-version reads, `ncp status`, `ncp cost`, `ncp explain`
- Redis-backed coordination for the pgvector path: whispers, fetch-session
  state, handoff queue
- 2-attempt connection retry with 100 ms backoff on pgvector and Redis paths

### Retrieval

- `RetrievalPolicy` dataclass: fuses BM25 (w=0.5), recency decay (w=0.3),
  and `base_trust` (w=0.2) into a normalized `[0, 1]` score
- Both `SQLiteStore` and `PgvectorStore` share the same policy — behavior is
  intentionally aligned across backends
- Generation penalty applied multiplicatively in `policy.score()`
- Zero-overlap guard preserved

### Interface / ABC

- `BaseStore` ABC now declares all methods both concrete stores implement:
  `log_conscious`, `peek_whispers`, `acknowledge_whispers`, `log_cost_raw`,
  `get_pipeline_goal_versions` are all `@abstractmethod`
- `HandoffStore` Protocol in `agent_handoff.py` kept only as backward-compat
  alias; duck-type `hasattr` guard removed; all handoff functions typed against
  `BaseStore`
- `SupportsAssemblyStore` Protocol kept for backward compat with duck-typed
  test stubs in `test_assembler_phase3.py`

### Workflow

- `ncp handoff claude` and `ncp handoff opencode` commands for whisper-driven
  partner/reviewer orchestration loops
- Sarathi + NCP handoff orchestration validated end to end

### Docs

- CHANGELOG updated with full 0.2.0 entry
- README updated: version, next-focus, "How NCP Reduces Token Cost" section

## What Shipped In 0.3.0

- `ncp consolidate` — tag pre-cluster + BM25 merge, dry_run, consolidation_ready whisper
- `ncp calibrate` — batch trust decay + manual override, user_verified protection
- `ncp viz` — 5-panel operator view (distribution, age, top chunks, pipelines, whispers)
- `ncp batch` — JSONL batch processor, no MCP server required
- BaseStore ABC: consolidate, calibrate, viz_data all @abstractmethod
- Suite: 306 passed, 6 skipped

## Active Line: 0.4.x

The `0.3.0` consolidation and operator tooling line is closed. Work now moves
to the `0.4.x` release hardening and streaming line.

### Next focus

1. pgvector schema migrations and upgrade tooling
2. Streaming / incremental assembly for very long turns
3. Calibration driven by retrieval feedback (not just age decay)
4. Vector-only retrieval path for non-BM25 backends

## Known Architectural Gaps (carried forward)

- `SupportsAssemblyStore` Protocol still partially duplicates `BaseStore` —
  long-term the Assembler should accept `BaseStore` directly once test stubs
  are updated
- query result count semantics still opinionated inside store methods
- pgvector production posture still needs connection pooling

## Recommended Agent Roles

- **Claude**: bounded implementation/planning partner
- **OpenCode**: bounded reviewer (`opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free`)
- **NCP**: handoff transport and shared bounded context
- **Sarathi**: task/evidence tracking

## Recommended Orchestration Loop

1. Emit a bounded NCP whisper to Claude with slice, target files, acceptance
   criteria
2. Let Claude produce a bounded proposal or implementation
3. Emit the resulting bounded handoff to OpenCode for review
4. Apply only the accepted fixes
5. Run focused tests then full suite
6. Update docs
7. Commit and push

## Suggested Prompt For The Next Orchestrator

> Read `docs/NCP_0_2_0_HANDOFF_PACKET.md` first. The `0.2.0` line is closed
> and tagged at `v0.2.0`. We are opening the `0.3.0` consolidation and
> operator tooling line. Start with subconscious consolidation — a background
> pass that merges/prunes redundant chunks and trims tombstones so long-running
> pipelines don't accumulate noise. Keep SQLite and pgvector aligned. Use NCP
> handoffs for bounded coordination. Prefer correctness and tests over broad
> refactors.
